The goal of the scenarioSelector
[app](https://twodii.shinyapps.io/scenarioSelector/) is to help you find and
visualize a scenario.

## Installation

Install the development version of scenarioSelector from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/scenarioSelector")
```

## Example

```{r example}
if (interactive()) {
  scenarioSelector::run_app()
}
```

## Need

We are questioning the need of this tool, based on grant proposals and reports
(cc' Léonie Ségala).

## Related work

This tool was attempted and abandoned twice before:

* The first attempt
([CapitalMarketsPlatform](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/CapitalMarketsPlatform),
[cc' `@pranavpandya84`](https://github.com/pranavpandya84)) was retired because
it doesn't seem to work (the questions seems to not filter the data).

* The second attempt
([r2dii.scenario.selector](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.scenario.selector),
[cc' `@jdhoffa`](https://github.com/jdhoffa)) is a lighter version of the fist
one -- built from the top down. It was also retired because it inherited the
bugs of the first one, and still has complexity that makes it hard to debug.

## Criteria to select scenarios

The first attempt to build this tool
([CapitalMarketsPlatform](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/CapitalMarketsPlatform))
includes a number of questions, as a criteria to pick relevant scenarios. Now we
may either try to (a) implement those original questions, or (b) develop new
questions.

I suspect developing new questions will be easiest:

* The relevant grants seem to not commit to any specific question.
* The original questions 
    * seem not obviously useful or updated, and
    * may be hard to translate into criteria to pick scenarios.
* The new questions
    * could be develop to be easy to implement, and
    * could be developed to be clearly useful with minimal input from analysts.
